**Cyclone / Hurricane / Typhoon**

| Role profile 2 | Competencies | Gaps in competencies | Gaps in information they need |
|:---------------|:-------------|:---------------------|:------------------------------|
| **NS community health (non-clinical work) programme staff (non-emergency)** | Training in community health approaches for long-term health programming, not specific to emergencies | Specific adaptations needed for health emergencies, exposure to response approaches, tools, needs outside of sudden-onset natural disasters. Technical responses per disease type, understanding of epidemic profiles for each type of disaster (support for planning programming/health response) | Understanding of health impacts and timeline of natural disasters, tools and approaches available. How to plan for health needs immediately after sudden-impact disaster |

**Cyclone / Hurricane / Typhoon**

| Key facts | Cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are associated with damage to infrastructure from high winds and storm surges, and flooding. |&nbsp;|
|:----------|:--------------------|-----------|
| **Main health impacts** | Trauma (injury) is most likely during a cyclone/hurricane/typhoon, or in the immediate aftermath. In the days, weeks (and sometimes months) following a cyclone/hurricane, the main health concerns are: |&nbsp; |
| &nbsp; | Health issues | **Mechanism** |
| &nbsp; | Diarrhoeal diseases | Contamination of water supplies by flood water, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices |
| &nbsp; | Vector-borne diseases | Flooding or stagnant water that increases the risk of breeding sites for vectors |
| &nbsp; | Respiratory illnesses and vaccine-preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters |
| &nbsp; | Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock, disrupting normal services and impacting NCD treatment, and maternal and child health services |
| **Risk factors leading to an outbreak/epidemic** | ● Poor WASH conditions<br>● Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged<br>● Inadequate or crowded shelters<br>● Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies<br>● Lack of access to health care facilities | |
| **Priority actions** | Critical steps |	● Ensure triage, treatment, referral and transport for injured and “near drowning” patients. <br>● Identify key disease risk factors and implement prevention and preparedness. <br>● Establish critical health services. <br>● Identify and manage possible sources of toxic contamination. |
|&nbsp;| Surveillance | ● Activate disease early warning systems and community-based surveillance.<br>● Survey vectors and breeding sites with measures to reduce vector density. |
|&nbsp;| Primary health care intervention |● Ensure continuity of health service delivery, including maternal and child health care, and NCDs treatment.<br>● Provide specific primary care interventions for diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, Hepatitis A, typhoid, skin infections, and snake and insect bites.<br>● Provide treatment for “near drowning” and exposure.<br>● Provide treatment for malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases.<br>● Take care of minor wounds and skin infections, including tetanus immunisation.|
|&nbsp;|	Community-based action and social mobilisation |● Implement SBCC interventions aimed at preventing water- and vector-borne diseases.<br>● Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed.<br>● Put procedures in place to safely manage human and animal corpses.<br>● Ensure early detection, referral and treatment of all people with infectious disease symptoms, especially the most vulnerable.<br>● Psychosocial support for community members, staff and volunteers<br>● Prevention of WASH-related diseases:<br>o Hand-washing with soap<br>o Safe excreta disposal<br>o Safe drinking water<br>o Environmental sanitation<br>o Food safety. |
|&nbsp;| Coordination| ● Coordination between agencies and sectors including Health, Nutrition, WASH and Shelter<br>● Coordination between rescue services and health services (including levels 1, 2 and 3 facilities)<br>● Coordination of volunteers |
