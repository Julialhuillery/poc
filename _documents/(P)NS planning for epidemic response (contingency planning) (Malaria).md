| **FACT SHEET** ||
| **Importance** | In 2016, 91 countries and areas had ongoing malaria transmission. The WHO estimates there were 216 million cases of malaria in 2016 and 445 000 deaths. Countries in Africa reported 90% of cases and 92% of deaths of malaria globally.<br>Malaria epidemics do not generally occur in high-transmission areas (other than when there is migration of non-immune persons into these areas). This is because the population has developed partial immunity to the disease. Continuous exposure to malaria infection provides immunity in people after a certain age but this immunity is transient. People who remain uninfected over a short period (less than one year) become newly susceptible to the disease. Therefore, those living in areas of seasonal or low transmission do not develop adequate immunity and can be vulnerable to the disease every season.<br>Since epidemics occur in areas where populations have inadequate immunity, malaria cases can be high, with very high rates of morbidity and mortality. |
| **Case definition** | <u>Case definitions for malaria control (different case definitions are used for malaria elimination):</u><br><u>Suspected malaria case</u>: Patient illness is suspected by a health worker to be due to malaria. The criteria for suspected malaria usually include fever or a history of fever. These criteria vary according to local circumstances and are established by the national malaria control programme. All suspected cases of malaria are tested by either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).<br><u>Presumed (not tested) malaria case</u>: In a suspected malaria case, the patient did not receive a diagnostic test but was nevertheless treated for malaria. Such cases have also been referred to as &#39;probable&#39; cases. However, in most settings, the chance that a suspected case will be confirmed is \< 50%, so the use of the term &#39;probable&#39; is inappropriate. Such cases are also referred to as &#39;unconfirmed&#39; cases. In this guide, the term used is &#39;presumed malaria case&#39;.<br><u>Confirmed malaria case</u>: A suspected case of malaria in which malaria parasites have been demonstrated, generally by microscopy or an RDT, becomes a confirmed case. The definition implies that the patient displayed symptoms of malaria, and the presence of parasites was confirmed. In some suspected cases with a positive test, particularly in populations that have acquired immunity to malaria, febrile illness may be due to other causes. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of confirmed malaria is still given. If a concurrent disease is suspected, it should be further investigated and treated. |
| **Alert/epidemic threshold** | Twice the average number of cases seen in the previous three weeks for a location |
| **Risk assessment** | Event description: type of disaster, characteristics of displacement<br>Host: community practices, cultural practices, chemoprophylaxis coverage<br>Agent: endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality<br>Environment: presence of vectors, shelter, availability and access to health and social care |
| **Attack rate** | ● It depends on the level of natural immunity of the population. Infections are often asymptomatic. |
| **Vulnerable people** | ● Infants, children under five years of age<br>● Pregnant women<br>● People living with HIV<br>● Non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers |
| **Infectious agent** | There are five _Plasmodium_ (parasite) species that cause malaria in humans, and two of these species – _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ – pose the greatest threat. |
| **Reservoir/Host** | Humans (monkey for _P. knowlesi_, present in South-Eastern Asia, particularly on Borneo) |
| **How disease is spread (modes of transmission)** | Vector-borne<br>● _Anopheles_ mosquito bite<br>● The mosquitoes usually bite between sunset and sunrise during the night. |
| **Incubation period** | Seven to forty days. Antimalarial drugs taken for prophylaxis by travellers can delay the appearance of malaria symptoms by weeks or months, long after the traveller has left the malaria-endemic area. |
| **Period of infectiousness** | Not directly transmitted person to person. Humans may infect mosquitoes if infectious parasites are in the blood. This varies with parasite species and with response to treatment. |
| **Community case definition** | A fever that goes up and down, with spells of extreme heat and shivering<br><br>Any person with fever in a malaria endemic area<br>Any under-five child who has an illness with high fever and a danger sign\*<br>(\*Danger signs include lethargy, unconsciousness, vomiting everything, convulsions, and in children less than five years, inability to drink or breastfeed) |
