      <td>In 2016, 91 countries and areas had ongoing malaria transmission. The WHO estimates there were 216 million cases of malaria in 2016 and 445 000 deaths. Countries in Africa reported 90% of cases and 92% of deaths of malaria globally. Malaria epidemics do not generally occur in high-transmission areas (other than when there is migration of non-immune persons into these areas). This is because the population has developed partial immunity to the disease. Continuous exposure to malaria infection provides immunity in people after a certain age but this immunity is transient. People who remain uninfected over a short period (less than one year) become newly susceptible to the disease. Therefore, those living in areas of seasonal or low transmission do not develop adequate immunity and can be vulnerable to the disease every season.<br />Since epidemics occur in areas where populations have inadequate immunity, malaria cases can be high, with very high rates of morbidity and mortality.</td>

      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Case definition</strong></td>
      <td><u>Case definitions for malaria control (different case definitions are used for malaria elimination):<br /></u><u>Suspected malaria case</u>: Patient illness is suspected by a health worker to be due to malaria. The criteria for suspected malaria usually include fever or a history of fever. These criteria vary according to local circumstances and are established by the national malaria control programme. All suspected cases of malaria are tested by either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).<br /><u>Presumed (not tested) malaria case</u>: In a suspected malaria case, the patient did not receive a diagnostic test but was nevertheless treated for malaria. Such cases have also been referred to as 'probable' cases. However, in most settings, the chance that a suspected case will be confirmed is &lt; 50%, so the use of the term 'probable' is inappropriate. Such cases are also referred to as 'unconfirmed' cases. In this guide, the term used is 'presumed malaria case'.<br /><u>Confirmed malaria case</u>: A suspected case of malaria in which malaria parasites have been demonstrated, generally by microscopy or an RDT, becomes a confirmed case. The definition implies that the patient displayed symptoms of malaria and the presence of parasites was confirmed. In some suspected cases with a positive test, particularly in populations that have acquired immunity to malaria, febrile illness may be due to other causes. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of confirmed malaria is still given. If a concurrent disease is suspected, it should be further investigated and treated.</td>
