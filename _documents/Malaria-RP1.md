| **FACT SHEET** |
| **Importance** | In 2016, 91 countries and areas had ongoing Malaria transmission. The WHO estimates there were 216 million cases of Malaria in 2016 and 445,000 deaths. Countries in Africa reported 90% of cases and 92% of deaths of Malaria globally.Malaria epidemics do not generally occur in high-transmission areas (other than when there is migration of non-immune persons into these areas). This is because the population has developed partial immunity to the disease. Continuous exposure to Malaria infection provides immunity in people after a certain age but this immunity is transient. People who remain uninfected over a short period (less than one year) become newly susceptible to the disease. Therefore, those living in areas of seasonal or low transmission do not develop adequate immunity and can be vulnerable to the disease every season.<br>Since epidemics occur in areas where populations have inadequate immunity, Malaria cases can be high, with very high rates of morbidity and mortality. |
| **Risk assessment** | Event description: type of disaster, characteristics of displacement<br>Host: community practices, cultural practices, chemoprophylaxis coverage<br>Agent: endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality<br>Environment: presence of vectors, shelter, availability and access to health and social care. |
| **Vulnerable people** | ● Infants, children under five years of age<br>● Pregnant women<br>● People living with HIV<br>● Non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers.|
| **How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)** | Vector Borne<br>● _Anopheles_ mosquito bite.<br>● The mosquitoes usually bite between sunset and sunrise during the night. |
| **Community case definition** | A fever that goes up and down, with spells of extreme heat and shivering.<br><br>Any person with fever in a malaria endemic area.<br>Any under five child who has an illness with high fever and a danger sign\*<br>(\*Danger signs include lethargy, unconsciousness, vomits everything, convulsions, and in children less than 5, unable to drink or breast-feed) |
| **Community-level disease tools** | [CBHFA module]( https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/health/cbhfa/toolkit/)<br><br>ECV disease tools (all relating to malaria) |

**Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control of malaria?**

| **Activity** | **Evidence of effectiveness** |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
| :--- | :--- | --- | --- | --- |
|&nbsp;| **High** | **Moderate** | **Low** | **No evidence** |
| (Referral for) Early and effective treatment (aligned with national anti-malarial drug policy) | ✔ |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|

**Indicators and targets**

The indicators and targets below can be adapted to specific contexts and should be used for monitoring and evaluation of: i) progress of the epidemic and characteristics, and ii) measuring Red Cross/Crescent activities.
