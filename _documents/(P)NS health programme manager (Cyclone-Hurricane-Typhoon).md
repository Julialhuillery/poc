**Cyclone / Hurricane/ Typhoon**

| **Key facts** | Cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are associated with damage to infrastructure from high winds and storm surges, and flooding. ||
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main health impacts** | Trauma (injury) is most likely during a cyclone/hurricane/typhoon, or in the immediate aftermath. In the days, weeks (and sometimes months) following a cyclone/hurricane, the main health concerns are:|
|&nbsp;| Health concern | Mechanism |
|&nbsp;| Diarrhoeal diseases | Contamination of water supplies by flood water, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices. |
|&nbsp;| Vector-borne diseases | Flooding or stagnant water can increase the risk of breeding sites for vectors. |
|&nbsp;| Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters. |
|&nbsp;| Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock disrupt normal services impacting NCD treatment, and maternal and child health services. |
| **Risk factors leading to an outbreak/epidemic** | ● Poor WASH conditions<br>● Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged<br>● Inadequate or crowded shelter<br>● Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies<br>● Lack of access to health care facilities. |
| **Priority actions** | Critical steps | ● Ensure triage, treatment, referral and transport for injured and &quot;near drowning&quot; patients<br>● Identify key disease risk factors and implement prevention and preparedness<br>● Establish critical health services<br>● Identify and manage possible sources of toxic contamination |
|&nbsp;| Surveillance | ● Activate disease early warning systems and community based surveillance<br>● Survey vectors and breeding sites with measures to reduce vector density. |
|&nbsp;| Primary health care intervention | ● Continuity of health service delivery, including maternal and child health care, and NCDs treatment<br>● Specific primary care interventions for diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, Hepatitis A, Typhoid, skin infections, snake and insect bites<br>● Treatment for &quot;near drowning&quot; and exposure<br>● Treatment for malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases<br>● Care of minor wounds and skin infections, including Tetanus immunization. |
|&nbsp;| Community based action and social mobilisation | ● Implement SBCC interventions aimed at preventing water and vector-borne diseases<br>● Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed<br>● Procedures in place to safely manage human and animal corpses<br>● Early detection, referral and treatment of all people with infectious disease symptoms, especially the most vulnerable<br>● Psychosocial support for community members, and staff and volunteers<br>● Prevention of WASH related diseases:<br>o Handwashing with soap<br>o Safe excreta disposal<br>o Safe drinking water<br>o Environmental Sanitation<br>o Food Safety. |
|&nbsp;| Coordination | ● Coordination between agencies and sectors including Health, Nutrition, WASH &amp; Shelter<br>● Coordination between rescue services and health services (including level 1,2 and 3 facilities)<br>● Coordination of volunteers. |
| **Disease Tools that may be relevant** | ● Diarrhoeal disease<br>● Malaria<br>● Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika <br>● Yellow fever<br>● ARIs<br>● Respiratory diseases | ● Hepatitis A<br>● Hepatitis E <br>● Typhoid fever<br>● Malnutrition <br>● Measles<br>● Meningococcal disease<br>● Vaccine-preventable<br>● Polio. |
