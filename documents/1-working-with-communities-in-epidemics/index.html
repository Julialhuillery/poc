    <h1 id="section-3-working-with-communities-in-epidemics">Section 3: Working with Communities in Epidemics</h1>

<p>Working with communities is fundamental to the Movement’s emergency response and preparedness, no matter what the hazard or context. Lessons learnt from previous epidemics, especially the West Africa Ebola crisis, have highlighted the crucial role communities play in preventing and controlling epidemics. Supporting communities to be better prepared, to detect and respond to public health threats at the local level is crucial to the success of epidemic prevention and control efforts. However, epidemics present several unique challenges to working with communities during health crises.</p>

<p>Epidemics can generate significant fear, panic and stigma. People’s health beliefs and practices are deeply personal and often driven by culture, tradition and customs that are not always easily understood or adapted to epidemic risk. This section aims to support NS program managers to adapt current tools and practices to engage with communities in the epidemic context. It outlines the guiding principles and lessons learnt on how to actively communicate and engage with communities across the epidemic curve.<br />
Behaviour change is a key element in any epidemic control response. Implementing communication strategies through a Psychosocial and social cultural lens ensures behaviour change initiatives are adapted to the context and remain responsive to the changing conditions.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Communities   are actively engaged and kept at the centre</strong></th>
      <th style="text-align: left"><strong>Engaging   with communities, involving them in decision-making and design of activities   and messages, and listening to their fears, perceptions and feedback needs to   be a priority in epidemic response.        Epidemics   can cause fear, panic and misinformation that can undermine response efforts   and lead to the disease spreading very quickly. Communication channels   and engagement strategies that communities trust is key.</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Understand   cultural context</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Activities   and messages that are culturally informed (and technically sound) will be   accepted by communities. Community preferences, perception and social and   cultural factors must be understood and incorporated to facilitate behaviour   change and reduce health risks. Even diseases that have a cure or vaccine spread   quickly if the community refuses to utilise the intervention. Responders must   be willing to negotiate and comprise to ensure effective interventions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work   through a PSS lens at all times</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Epidemics   can cause significant amounts of fear, panic and grief.  Understanding that communities and response   teams are both affected by the trauma of the epidemic, is important to ensure   that PSS is central to the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address   people’s perception of risk</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">People   have different perceptions about the seriousness of a disease and their   susceptibility to it, which impacts how anxious they are about getting the   disease. People also have different perceptions about how effective the   control measures are (perceived efficacy), and how well they as individuals   are able to do what is recommended (self-efficacy). All these factors must be   assessed and used to design effective community engagement and behaviour   change interventions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Manage   rumours and misinformation</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Rumours,   myths and misconceptions are all barriers to effective communication,   prevention and control, and can generate fear, panic and confusion or loss of   trust. At the same time, a lack of trust in authorities or the health system   can often mean information about epidemics and how to control them is misconstrued.   Active listening for rumours and misinformation, verification and then acting   through trusted communication channels to address them is critical for   effective SBCC.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Move   from key messages to key facts</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Communities   and volunteers interpret and contextualise information to help them   understand. In the past, we have relied on carefully worded ‘key messages’   that we have trained volunteers deliver.    This method fails to recognise the local context and adaption of   messages that occur when information gets passed from one person to another.   Training volunteers on the key facts of a disease allows them to understand   the disease better. It also allows them to adapt the facts to local context,   beliefs and to combat rumours more effectively.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Recognise   diversity within communities</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Communities   are not homogeneous; different people and communities may perceive risks   differently – just as they may have different social norms, cultural beliefs   and practices. Certain groups may be hidden or stigmatised within communities;   think about sex, age, chronic health conditions as well as ethnicity, sexual   orientation and those with physical or learning disabilities. Extra effort is   required to identify, engage and mobilise these groups.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Continuous,   data-driven cycle of feedback and adaptation</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Community   engagement needs to be responsive. As an epidemic begins, people may fear the   disease a lot. This can increase their perception of the seriousness of the   disease as well as their susceptibility to it. As the epidemic evolves,   motivating factors and risk perception will change – sometimes quickly. This   means that constant review and adaptation of messages and strategies is   necessary to ensure that programming is targeting the right risks, right   people and right places. Epidemics need closer and more regularly monitoring   of fear, risk perception, rumours and misunderstanding than general   emergencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Driven   by the epidemic curve</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Decisions   on communication and engagement strategies need to be driven by   epidemiological data as well as data from communities. As an epidemic evolves   and number of cases increases or decreases, the risk perception, fear,   barriers and motivators also change. SBCC needs to be dynamic and responsive,   and it is important to understand what we are communicating to whom, through   what channel and when, right along the epidemic curve – not only at the   beginning and end. Keep in mind also that different communities can be in   different phases of the epidemic at the same time; for example, cases may be   declining in one community but in the neighbouring community they are still   increasing, and risks are high.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SBCC is   integrated into and supports all aspects of the response</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">SBCC should be integrated into all aspects of an epidemic response – it is not a   pillar on its own. Information collected and discussed as part of SBCC   activities can be extremely valuable to guide and support other response   activities, such as community engagement for case management, contact tracing   an PSS. Ensure that SBCC information is available and supports all aspects of   a response operation to engage communities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Values   volunteers (and communicates with them too)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Volunteers are at the ‘front-line’ of epidemic preparedness and response. They are well   placed to engage with leaders and community members, to communicate   information on health services and facilities, disease symptoms and   transmission, and to promote social and behaviour change. When working   through volunteers, it is important to address their misconceptions,   perceptions and attitudes (especially toward stigmatized or taboo groups) as   well as ensure they have the information support and protection that they   need.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accountable</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Working in an accountable way with communities means that they are listened to, have   opportunities to express their needs and ideas, and that information   collected from them is given back. Information collected through feedback   mechanisms and rumour monitoring must be shared with communities (including   how complaints, rumours and concerns were addressed).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Acknowledge   that epidemics affect more than the health of the community</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Epidemics affect all aspects of society. Large outbreaks should include all aspects of   response including a focus on protection, education and gender. It is   important to talk to communities about the impact of the epidemic beyond   their health care and ensure a wholistic response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Engage   in effective coordination and partnerships</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Ensure active engagement and cooperation with the Ministry of Health and national   coordination structures, emphasizing consistent messages and communication   channels. Volunteers often provide critical mobilisation support to national   campaigns or efforts; it is important to have clearly defined roles and   responsibilities for volunteers. Internally, Health and WASH teams need to   work closely together to ensure that activities complement each other (rather   than duplicate), and that messages, feedback mechanisms and volunteers   training are done jointly or harmonized.</td>
