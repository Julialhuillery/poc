# Psychosocial support interventions

[Psychosocial support activities](/pyschosocial-support-in-epidemics/) can be integrated into other epidemic response activities or be implemented as stand-alone psychosocial support activities. Given the impact that fear, grief, shame and isolation can have on all aspects of the response, especially communication and community engagement, it is recommended that psychosocial support be integrated into all activities and all volunteers and staff are trained in psychological first aid (PFA).

Depending on the type of disease and the scope of the outbreak, there may be a need for stand-alone psychosocial support activities. Examples of the different types of activities are included below:

**a)** **Psychosocial support integrated into other epidemic response activities** can include using supportive communication techniques and PFA skills, sharing information on stress and coping actively, or the inclusion of PSS volunteers in community mobilization teams to promote trust and reduce fear. 

Psychosocial support should also be integrated within other sectors to promote psychological wellbeing and ensuring dignity. In WASH activities for example this could mean the inclusion of culturally appropriate latrine and bathing facilities that maximise privacy and dignity and are inclusive for people with disabilities. It could also mean that water points are positioned so people do not have to walk unreasonable distances. 

In health, psychosocial support activities may include the training of doctors and nurses in supportive communication and referral procedures, and the inclusion of psychosocial support staff within mobile health clinics. If health volunteers are doing house visits they should also have training in PFA, stress and coping as well as information on referral procedures and available mental health and psychosocial support services.        

â€‹Supportive communication is a style of communication that promotes safety, calm and trust. Supportive communication takes time to talk and explain what is happening to an individual (patient, community member or other) and to listen to their questions and fears. When a someone is applying supportive communication they:  

1. Stay close to the individual  
2. Listen attentively    
3. Accept feelings (without judgement or correction)
4. Provide care and practical support.          
 
**b)** **Stand-alone psychosocial support activities** may include PFA or lay counselling, psychoeducation, support to unaccompanied or separated children in disease treatment centres, and support for mourning and grieving if usual burial practices are not possible due to safety considerations.

Children are often particularly vulnerable during epidemic outbreaks if their caretakers fall sick they are prevented them from caring and interacting with their children. Psychosocial support activities should focus on activating available resources from relatives and community members. Some diseases, medication, or admission to a treatment centre may stop mothers from being able to breastfeed their infants, and can disrupt the mother-infant bond. The infant is likely to be impacted due to a lack of breastmilk (malnutrition risk) but will also miss being stimulated (e.g. playing, singing, rocking) by their mother. Mothers and infants are important target groups for PSS.
