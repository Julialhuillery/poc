There are some specific challenges involved in providing PFA in the context of an epidemic or disease outbreak which are important to consider. Some of them are listed below but it is recommended to assess the specific challenges for each outbreak.

●       It can be challenging to conduct PFA to someone who is affected by a contagious disease due to the risk of transmission. It is important to consider the safety of the volunteers first and ensure that they are not exposed to risk when providing PFA. On the other hand, it is important not to reproduce stigma surrounding the disease and provide needed support when a person is declared free of transmission. During a specific outbreak, the specific risks and safety procedures should be assessed and the PFA action principles and/or training material for volunteers should be adapted accordingly. It might be necessary to provide PFA though telephones or apps, or the volunteer must keep a safe distance while providing PFA in person.

* It may prove challenging to connect someone to loved ones and rebuild social supports if a person has suffered significant losses during the outbreak. Volunteers can help affected people identify supports in their life and become reintegrated in the community or identify new avenues for social support through longer term PSS programmes such as support groups for survivors.
*  There are many rumours during epidemic outbreaks, which means it is even more important to provide clear and consistent information about the disease and available support. When giving information, be aware that you as the helper can become a target of the fear, frustration and anger that people may feel. Try to remain calm and be understanding. Also, try to be aware of the more common rumours so that you are prepared to respond with reliable and accurate information.
